  "Integrating jinja macros into your linting configuration"

## Jinja Templating
SDF Lint and Format are guaranteed to be compatible with all elements in an SDF workspace,
including jinja macros, and materialization libraries. 

Jinja does not materially impact the performance of SDF Lint, and lint violations are provided 
at the level of the source SQL code, not pre-processed (ie. post jinja-expansion) level. This makes
debugging easier.

### Configuration
No additional configuration is needed for SDF workspaces using macros.

### Linting dbt Projects
SDF lint is not (as of now) compatible with dbt projects. If you'd like that capability, let us know in
our [community slack](https://sdf.com/join)!
