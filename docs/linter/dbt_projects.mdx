  "Configuring the SDF linter to work with DBT Projects"
---

### Overview
Linting dbt SQL projects helps maintain quality, readability, and consistency across code. DBT projects have additional complexity
in linting due to jinja resolution.

Most solutions at the moment use SQLFluff, integrated with dbt to lint DBT projects.

SDF allows for efficient linting of DBT projects. SDF uses the `dbt parse` step for an initial parsing of the dbt project, then SDF's internals take over for linting.
Since SDF's lint rules are designed to be equivalent to SQLFLuff, this allows for easy migration from SQLFluff to SDF's linter. 

### Requirements
* A valid dbt project, that can be parsed via `dbt parse`
* A version of SDF >0.4.5

### Getting Started

### Jaffle Shop Tutorial
This tutorial will show you how to add SDF's linter to your the classic Jaffle Shop dbt project.
<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone Jaffle Shop">
        Clone (Jaffle Shop Classic)[https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-classic] and follow the steps to get the project to `dbt compile` correctly.

        You can follow the instructions (here)[https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-classic?tab=readme-ov-file#running-this-project]
        SDF's linter uses the results of the `dbt parse` step to understand how to introspect queries, source macro definitions, and more.
        So, try runnning `dbt parse` and ensure that this finishes without errors!

        <Note>
            You may want to use a python virtual environment for this!
        </Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Initialize an SDF workspace">
            In the same directory level as the `dbt_project.yml`, create a new file: `workspace.sdf.yml`.
            Let's go through this line by line.
            * The name of the workspace is the SDF internal name for the project.
            * the edition is the current [sdf-schema](/reference/sdf-yml) edition
            * The defaults let SDF know that the preprocessor is jinja, and the target SQL dialect is snowflake
            * The dbt block points SDF to introspect the DBT project.
            
        ```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
        workspace:
          name: "jaffle_shop_classic"
          edition: "1.3"
          defaults:
            preprocessor: jinja
            dialect: snowflake
          dbt:
            enabled: true
            target-dir: target
            auto-parse: true
            #profile: default
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Lint Jaffle Shop">
        Run `sdf lint` in your command line to have SDF lint all files in the dbt project.
        By default, the dbt linting configuration is the same [default](/linter/overview#default-rules) as for all SDF projects.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Customize the Linter">
        Customize the linter using the `sdf-args:` yml block. This allows you to configure all rules.
        ```yaml workspace.sdf.yml
        ---
        sdf-args:
        lint: >
            -w capitalization-keywords=upper
            -w structure-else-null
            ...
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Try It On Your Project!">
        The steps above are identical for your own project. All you need are
        * A parse-able dbt project (with `dbt parse`)
        * An appropriately configured `workspace.sdf.yml`
    </Step>
    
</Steps>
